## ABE 516X Project by Ben Smtih

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model for predicting the air flow through an air filter wall bank. This project is based on the use of air filters in animal agriculture building ventilation systems. These systems employ large numbers of pre-filters and v-bank filters (primary and secondary filters) making testing filters very expensive. The primary objective of this project is to model the air flow using the ventilation system parameters. These will be discussed in futre sections.

### Data Aquisition

You can see this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to work with Markdown language for adding features into this website.  This includes how to add headers, organization (e.g., bullets or lists), tables, and images.  It also includes how to add code to a website.

*Note that for images, you will need to place the image file in a place that it can be referenced and called.  I would suggest the github repo might be a good solution.  Often, I make an images folder and can call the raw images file.

See example [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate/blob/master/index.md).  You can see the raw code also.

#### Data Wrangling Tasks
To create links to other pages, you can read this article:  https://github.blog/2016-12-05-relative-links-for-github-pages/.  Note that these pages should by default direct to the same local folder/directory the index file is.  In this case, my README.md file is my index. If the files are in a different folder, one should specifiy the path for that folder.

### Data Exploration

You can use a website to host notebooks.  First, you'll want to get the "raw" url from Github where your notebook is stored.  Then, navigate to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org and paste that URL.  The result will be a new generated URL that hosts your notebook.  This can be a [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/isu-abe/516x/blob/master/module2/bootcamp/notebooks/nocode/Module%20IIB%20-%20Python%20Basics%20-%20no%20code.ipynb) in your website.

## Modeling Methods


### Modeling Results 

What is the scientitifc goal?  What would you do if you had all the data?  What do you want to predict or estimate?  Why is this relevant to ABE researchers or the field?  Provide some background on the rationale and relevance.

### Results and Discussion

### Class Exercise

In each project, I'd like to see a homework assignment that the class can do/evaluate to learn more about your data.  This should be a reproducible notebook that allows them to learn one or more aspects of your data workflow.  It is also an opportunity to share your research with your colleagues.

Here is an example of a fantastic project website:
